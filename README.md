# WSJT-X_UDP_parser
UDP server and WSJT-X message parser for C++ VS Studio. This example runs in a command window
 and displays the UDP messages from WSJT-X, especially the tranmit control event messages. It 
 listens only as this is all that is necessary for transmitter control.

Adapted from a Python example (https://github.com/rstagers/WSJT-X) and assisted by ChatGPT.

Developed primarily to add to my Arduino DDS transmitter project to support FT8 and other protocols.
The plan is to add this to my TX control plugin for the SDRuno SDR (hence needing a c++ solution).
